<p>I am currently the Director & Head of Data Sciences at <a href="https://nference.ai">nference</a> which is an artificial intelligence company based in Cambridge, MA that aims to synthesize the worldâ€™s biomedical knowledge. In my role, I supervise data science research projects and collaborations with biopharma clients. Our team is developing state-of-the-art AI models to extract covariates from clinical notes and predict cardiovascular conditions from 12-lead ECG data. In collaboration with the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/">Mayo Clinic</a>, we have published numerous real-world evidence studies on COVID-19, and our work has been cited by government agencies including the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/08/18/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-50/">White House</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/library/covid19/02262021_covidupdate.html">CDC</a>.</p>

Previously, I received my PhD in 2019 from the <a href="https://orc.mit.edu/">MIT Operations Research Center</a>. I had the privilege of working with Prof. <a href="https://dbertsim.mit.edu/">Dimitris Bertsimas</a> as my advisor, and my thesis was on the development of machine learning methods specialized for healthcare datasets with missing and uncertain values. During my studies, I co-developed <a href="https://docs.interpretable.ai/stable/OptImpute/">OptImpute</a> which is a state-of-the-art optimization-based imputation method. I am passionate about machine learning, natural language processing, and personalized medicine with a particular interest in research that has the potential to impact clinical care.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy running, swimming, and playing fetch with my dog <a href="assets/images/Lucy.JPEG">Lucy</a>. </p>
